[music]it's finally here sometimes there's amovie that comes out that i feel likewas just perfectly made for me okay theidea of you a romcom about an ha thewayplaying a single mom who catches the eyeof totally definitely not hairry stylesbrought to you by the guy from bottoms isaw the first trailer for this a whileago and i've been counting the daysbelieve you me i mean we all know howmuch of a masterpiece the afterfranchise was right so like trust mei've already got 18 seat belts on forthis train wreck of a mixed metaphor andlike i said it's finally here so comealong kids let's take a walk and checkout the idea of you but before thatreally quick this video is brought toyou by skillshare somehow summer isalmost here 2024 almost halfway donewhat is happening and for

rightnow golly g i sure wish i could learnhow to draw an anime well skill sharehas a whole learning path just forpeople like you but alex how do i knowwhere to start and where to go fromthere i'm so glad you asked thatquestion conveniently well skillsharehas the answer to all of this with whatthey call learning pads learning padsare where they've bundled severalclasses together all on the same topicto cover first starting out as a noviceand then going all the way toprofessional skill level and everythingin between let's say you're thinkingabout opening an etsy store on thelearning path they teach you how to evenstart thinking about your shop then howto build it how to take photos forwhatever you're selling and now suddenlyyou've got an etsy store that's betterthan like 90% of all the other ones orlet's say you love watching youtube andyou think that you'd be pretty good atvideo editing wow they have a wholelearning path just for how to do

literally havenothing to lose so click my link downbelow and get creative today okay backto the show now right first thing at thebeginning of this movie it plays thesame exact song that plays at the end oftall girl and i was just i was goinglike full vietnam flashback oh no hereit is tall girl 3 and haway is going tobe 6' 7 in this movie anyway so this issenen a 40-year-old single mom with a16-year-old daughter named izzy who'spacking up for a big trip to coachellaof all things while senen herself ispacking up for a big solo campingtripabsolutelyand i'm not going to read it yeah thisis pretty much how kelsey packs for likeliterally anything seven pairs of pantsand 45 books for a 3-day trip all rightlet's go now the thing is sal'sex-husband got izy these specialbackstage vip tickets to see herfavorite band when she was like 12august moon so daniel got her this likeall access backstage pass and a vip meetand greet with that boy band she used tolike august moon oh yeah they're cutethat sounds fun is did you get to meetaugust moon not really into them anymorenow it's more about like aggressivelytalented female singer songwriter whichi think is great yeah you know you couldhave just said he listened to chapelrone and saved us a whole bunch of timeokay anyway so like i said while izzyand the ex-husband daniel are going tobe at coachella so lena is going to gocamping all by herself which her friendsthink is like just the weirdestthing so you're going camping alone yesand why would you do that seriously whywouldn't i do that bears serial killersall right now not the bear versus manthing again please internet come on wejust got over this anyway so daniel goesto take izzy and her friends tocoachella and sen's about to head off onher own to dude the thing whatever andguess what daniel suddenly gets a callfrom work and has to completely changethe plans what do you know are you okayit's all good it's all good what'shappening i can't do the trip now danielmy whole merger thing just blew up i canyou please take that coachellaeverything's paid for all the hotels themeals it's all set are you kidding melook they're booking tickets to houstoni it's happening right now yeah sorryhoney i i got to go do some richbusinessman mller guy stuff like everyguy and every fanfic does for somereason so what ends up happening issenen has to cancel all her pl and takeher daughter and friends to coachellainstead which would just literally be mynightmare you spend 6 days and like$88,000 to listen to people be like yeahi'm up to like seven times a day now buti actually need it though cuz sometimesi think about glaucoma but yeah so senenis just kind of therenow hi you mind if i h no please thankyou this your first time sorry gettingmov oh no honey trust me i went to artschool so senen is kind of uncomfortableand doesn't really know care aboutwhat's going on here so she goes to findthe bathroom but she doesn't know wherethe special vip backstage coachellabathrooms are you know the ones with thecomplimentary needles so she wandersaround a bit and you'll never guesswhere she endsup oh uh just a secondokay hi hi ah man you have to use itafter a british guy have you seen whatthey eat but when she comes out of thebathroom he's still there because turnout funny story guys this isn't actuallya bathroom at all it's the trailer forone of the members of august moonar schsmiles are you a part of that asmrcommunity that gets off on listening topeople pee no i don't think you can justgo around assuming it's actually mytrailer this is your trailer yeah i'm inthe band we performing on the main stageandnow i'm hayescampbell that's right somehow shewandered her way backstage and peed inthe lead singer of august moon'sbathroom and hey is just like completelyunfaced by any of this this is a thirdtime this week i tell you what hey youknow if you wanted toum i don't know hangout hang out yeah i mean i've got allthe uh the the sodas the healthy onesnot so healthy onesumdid the way she slam that door so fasthey you know if you wanted to um i don'tknow hang out um i'm all in baby let'sgo so they get to talking about howshe's here for her daughter but herdaughter wasn't too thrilled about itbecause she's too old for boy bands nowyou know how it is we have wine um umvodka um i'm actually with my daughterforthe august moon we and greets yourdaughter she's um aust moon fan she wasat this moment today right now you areso seventh grade hey well let's justwalk that back a little bit there okaymy entire personality is based aroundhow nothing will ever be as good as thestuff i liked when i was in seventhgrade okay because it's easier to dothat than to blame my own life choicesfor why i'm not happy anymore so let'sjust back off the sass a little bit huhanyway so they kind of hang out for abit but then he has to go do the wholepop star thing so senen goes to do themeet and greet thing with for the vipthing with her daughter who's kind ofstarting to pick up on some weird vibesgoing on here what's happening to youguys oh we met earlier totally taking upenough of your time thank you g tointroduce me i'll have a white nightthis is izzy this is georgia zekehe and still don't know your name i'm sol now this seems important here becausethis is the first time in the movie thather name is actually spoken otherwise upto now she's called mom honey hey youand so on and this is the first timeshe's like acknowledged as her ownperson and it doesn't stop there okaybecause at the show later it kind ofsort of seems like hayes dedicates asong to senen just right there in frontof everybody yeah you know that partwhere he's like i love your hair and allthose annoying offputting personalitytraits you have yeah that part's totallyabout me now later on after coell andeverything's all done sen's working onher art gallery that she owns because ofcourse she does watch out hallmarkchannel amazon's coming for you and onthis very day you'll never guess whathappens hayes campbell of all peoplejust shows right up to cen's art galleryof all places now for some reason atfirst she's kind of mad that he's likebuying all the art that she's sellingwhich seems like a weird way to run abusiness what do i know i just makecartoons this is real art these are realartists they take their work veryseriously and you're coming in here likei don't know like you're buying applesor something honestly i genuinelyconnect with it and so i would reallylike to buy it if it's okay with youokay and for the record you have neverseen me buy apples before and afterbuying all the art senen takes him to wefriend's art warehouse where there'seven more stuff to show off like hershoulders yeah okay i'm on you selen youain't slick but of course theconversation goes from talking about artto talking about like life stories andstuff they could never tell anyone butsomehow it just feels so natural withyou i was an art history majoralthough i started out as premed italked to i was an 18-year-old peoplepleaser from new jersey but theni took an art history class for thecredits and i fell in love tell me howdoes one find oneself in a boyband it's very random you know likeslight tasy but an hatway is so prettyright like like what the heck and thewhole premise of this movie is like whatif this hot young popar guy fell in lovewith you a 40-year-old single mom butlike it's an hathway like every momwatching this movie movies is probablylike well yeah sure if i look like thismy life would probably be pretty cooltoo now they both get hungry and theywant to go get some food but rememberhay is like all famous and stuff alltime onhillhurst uh popularspot um it's pretty popular i guessit's okay actually let's go to my housei'm going to make you a sandwich coldred cold red run for your life it's anambush code red also i love how ubereats just like it doesn't exist in thisworld oh man i'd sure like to eat at arestaurant but i'm too famous goie gwhis if only there was some way to getfood from a restaurant and eat itsomewhere else but yeah so they hop onover to sen's house so she can make himsomething but what do you know crazytiming the fridge is broken and all thefood's going bad no no it's just it's myfridge is broken again so um i was justseeing how long it's been down but if ohno i mean this has definitely go like aweek left for sure oh mygod no it doesn't diary of so they cleanout the fridge together and finally getsome food made and then of course theycontinue the conversation from beforeabout each other's like dark brut andbackstories and all that like hayesauditioned for the group when he was 14and now he that he's famous his dad issuddenly deciding that he just reallywants to be in his life just randomlyout of nowhere dad's wanted a lot moreof a relationship in the last few yearswhich is really funny timing given thathe wasn't really there for the first 16years of my life now he wants to be bestmates it's hard to trust people is itand then of course the lens's like ohare we sharing trauma baggage you wantbaggage my dude i'm a 40-year-old singlemom you want baggage where the heck do ieven start we were out at dinner withhis work friends and u i was repeatingsome stupid gossip about uh someone weall knew who cheated on someone else andthe whole table went silent and i lookat daniel and he won't look at me butyou know jokes aside for a second thispart of the movie is just so perfectlike the way an hathaway's charactertalks about how she found out herhusband was cheating and how she feltand all that like just everything aboutthis scene is something that can reallyonly be done by someone with real lifeexperience like there's something in herperformance here that's not even actingit's just it just feels like someonereaching back into their life andtelling you something with with words ofcourse but also like the little face andeye movements you get here it's likelike you can't write this this issomething real you know but like imaginecheating on ann hathaway like even juston the most surface level most shallowlike whatever like your wife looks likethis and you're like like nah are youstupid anyway so then hayes does thehottest thing a hot guy could ever dobesides having forearms[music][applause]apparently oh my goodness the musicianguy plays music no way and then he triesto make out with her and be all like andshe's like oh heavens no wemustn't i could be your mother you'renot but i could be swear can i see youyethaz i can't do this why is that becauseyou're you and i'm me and we just don'tfit and so she sends him on his way nowlater on senen takes her daughter to thesummer camp from the parent trap and sobasically she just like has the houseall to herself for a while and one nightshe's intensely eagerly studying thetitle page of this book like like comeon i know you haven't made it past thetable of contents yet there okay i knowwhat a book looks like you can't fool meanyway suddenly hey starts texting herout of nowhere and all that resolve shehad before when she was like oh no wecouldn't possibly mr dy it just wouldn'tbe right all that goes right out thewindow within like 30 seconds when heinvites her to his hotel room in newyork city and she just kindof oh to have no pets or anything and beable to just fly across the country fora booty call at a moment'snoticehi hi mhm how's the flight[music]uneventful and then and then and thenthere's there's a lot of devil's tangoand then after they finish up all ofthat they get to talking more about likeemotions and feelings and stuff becauseoh hot guy with feelings and we get onemore peak inside of what's going on inthat little british noggin of his thehead of my label calls me the leadsinger of my favorite band wants to meetme and i get there and it's his 10 year-old daughter's birthday party i thinkthat's my greatest fear in life that i'ma joke oh so that's why you're dating awoman twice your age see look guys i'mnot just for kids okay this woman knowsall the words to the gummy bears themesong all right anyway so long storyshort he invites her to go with him onhis european tour so they can like hangout in hotel rooms and uh you know makepaper snowflakes i assume and one day onthis tour they go to ia and this iswhere things kind of start to unravel alittle bit so everyone there's likereally young right the guys are all 2324 and their groupies are totallydefinitely 19 you know what i'm sayingand everyone's kind of weirded out thathayes is dating this 40-year-old womanof all things and then hayes you knowreally up the end he when he dedicated asong to me closer of course that was theone we do that when one of us finds agirl or in haz's case a woman cute wepretend to change the set list at thelast minute it's a bit it's a bit that'sright the truth finally comes out theother shoe drops the calculator app onhis phone was fake the whole time seewhat i tell you men are all the sameonly want one thing banjo kazooie 3turns out this whole like meeting upwith hot ladies dedicating a song tothem at the show like this whole thinghas just been a bit that they do likeall the time and so more than anythingsen's just kind of embarrassed and feelspretty dumb that she would fall for allthis boy and clueless i guess can iexplain myself it was stupid i wastrying to impress you and it worked i iactually liked it not that that's any ofyour business i got swept up in the ideaof you oh she said the name of the moviein the movie guys that's that that's whyit has 81% rten tomatoes i don't thinkyou ever even gave gave us a chance imean does anyone in your life even knowabout me does your daughter do yourfriends you're ashamed of me is that itiam ashamed well yeah of course i washami'm banging the guy who was in thecamila cabo cinderella movie jamescordon and camila cabo in the same movieand you said yes no actually what she'sreferring to here is how she feels weirdabout dating such a young guy becauseone of the giant chips on her shoulderabout how her husband left her for ayounger woman which she thought was likepathetic and gross and all that and nowhere she is dating a guy even youngerthan that so she's not quite sure howlike icky she's supposed to feel aboutthis like the movie kind of touches onthis a little bit but it doesn't reallygo into it nearly as much as it couldhave like it's just kind of like hey isit weird that i'm dating someone wayyounger than my husband was doing whenhe cheated on me and then i said it wasgross no it's not weird why not cuz isaid so oh okay cool and so aftertalking and crying for awhile s and hayes break up however whenshe gets back home from europe turns outthere was some papar dudes who tookpictures of them like making out inparis and stuff and now it's all overthe internet and of course this alsomeans that her daughter now knows abouteverything and she's upset that her momdidn't even tell her in the first placebut more so she's mad at what people aresaying about her and this gives us thegreatest line in the entire movie youlike him yeah i do is he a feminist imean he is still a guy butum yeah he's a feminist why would youwake up with a talented kind feminist[music]okay i'm i'm sorry could we please justjust run that one more time but yeahhe's a feminist why would you wake upwith a talented kindfeminist 80% rten tomatoes everybody butyeah so then senen like completelychanges her mind again and goes to seehayes when he's in la and they get backtogether again it's going to be a lotwe're ready we'll just delete all oursocial media you're sure ignorance isbliss yeah you know it's reallya thebest thing you could do in thissituation cuz trust me no one gets moreupsetti spaghetti about anything thanchronically terminally online kidswho've never been in a relationshipbefore seeing a happy couple who aren'tlike literally exactly the same age nowof course okay surprising nobody oncethis is all public suddenly daniel ofall people the ex-husband remember thatguy just not having any of this myex-wife is dating that hot young richguy nonsense thank you very much what'syour end game here bro brodidn't realize we were on broad termsdaniel what are you doing here i'm goingto go get izzy it was really nice tohave met youbro what's up what's up yeah you cantell this man is at his limit okay imean he's so mad he's got both thumbs inhis pockets i haven't seen a grown manget this angry since i went to mysix-year-old nephew's soccer game butyeah so now that senen and hayes arepublic suddenly anyone and everyone hasan opinion on all these things that donot affect them in any way whatsoeverwhat do you have to say toall what what what a dumb question heyhow's it going spice channel news justwant to ask you a quick question herewhat do you have to say to all theheartbroken fans out there who somehowthought they would have a chance withhay gamble uh freaking get wrecked nerdsbut of course long story short this allends up being too hard on izzy becauseshe's still in high school and highschool kids famously known for theircomplex nuance thoughts and empathetictendencies are making izzy's life kindof suck there's that guy in b trevor youknow that i really like we've beentexting and i thought he liked me toobut then you know what he said to metoday tell your mom i turn 18 in a monthwell you see that's what jenniferlawrence is for okay have i got a moviefor you and so in the end senen andhayes decide to finally break up forreals for serious because it's just notfair to izzy just promise me you'llrevisit this in 5 years izzy will be outof school and i'll be some deistcelebrity that nobody gives ashrek if you get a shot at happenyou take it and then 5 years later haz'sbbl finally all healed up and guess whathappens happ be back there with yourname on[music]it shut up no i'm not and that's the endof the movie so like fundamentally thismovie is not really that much differentfrom like after or tall girl or like anyof these romcom romance things i'vecovered over the years right but all inall to be fair the movie's not quite asbad as i was expecting i mean hey it'sno secret of the use but still i meanit's just like literal romcom comfortfood like you know exactly what's goingto happen and how it's going to happenand everything but you know i feel likethat's the main reason that most peoplewatch romcom you romance drama moviewhatever this is in the first place likeyou want the meet cute to get togetherthe breakup and the reconciliation likethat's why people watch these moviesi've always thought that this is thebiggest strength but also the biggestweakness of romcoms because like it'shard to subvert the tropes when thoseare in fact the entire draw of thesemovies i mean i guess the movie beingabout an older woman getting with a guylike this it it is somewhat different atleast in execution because like i saidthere's a couple scenes in this moviethat you would never be able to get inlike a regular romcom type setting but imean hey the movie could have been a lotworse so there's that i guess heyeverybody thanks for watching this videoif you liked it please watch another onecuz that's how the algorithm works soclick on this one that's beingrecommended to you right now right hereon the screen it actually helps a lot ifyou do that cuz like that's how youtubeknows that my videos are worth caringabout also if you have any movies or tvshows you' like to recommend send me anemail at alex meers contact gmail andi'll put them on my absurdly long listof movies that i need to get to at somepoint anyway hope i made your day alittle bit better and i'll see you allnext time
